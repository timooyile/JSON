        <p class="text-center text-gray-600 mt-4">
            Data Fetching and Structure Issues;
                     There were errors due to undefined variables (students) and an unclear data structure. 
                     The solution involved first inspecting the JSON structure and then using flatMap() to flatten the data.
                      I ensured that the students array from all pages was properly aggregated before passing it into the chart functions. This resolved the issue of accessing undefined properties.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-gray-600 mt-4">
            Error Handling and Debugging;
 	            Several times, students or other variables were not defined, which led to errors like students is not defined.
                 Additionally, there were challenges with properly handling asynchronous data fetching.To Solve this I added console.log statements to inspect the data at various points in the code.
                  This helped identify where the issue occurred, and I made sure the data was properly passed through each step.
